## eDorado

by [Aniket Pant](http://aniketpant.com)

**eDorado** is an on-line treasure hunt that takes place every year as a part of [Quark](http://bits-quark.org).

I have built the website for the competition and now I am open-sourcing it.
The code has been slightly modified since the last edition of the competition.

The database required for hosting the website, will be available soon.

_Note: The code is in a miserable state. So, please be careful while extending._
